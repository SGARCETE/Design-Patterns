# Facade

**Facade** is a design pattern that compiles a subsystems' classes' functionality into one class which the user classes can use.
A good analogy to refer to is a setup Wizard, which allows you to set the settings and retrieve things you want through
one single interface, but even then it does not prevent every single functionality to be accessed through the specific
class it contains it.
