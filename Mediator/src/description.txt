Mediator is a design pattern that allows the communication logic to be centralized in the Mediator (contrary to observer,
where it merely publishes). It is very easy to maintain, and due to the use of User interface it gives a big degree
of decoupling due to the fact that the implementation of the User class is irrelevant to the Mediator.

In layman's terms, it simplifies communications among objects by introducing a single object that manages message
distribution among the others. An amazing example of this pattern are conference calls.
