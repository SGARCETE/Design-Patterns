In a way, Abstract Factory is the ultimate Factory design pattern. It is used to generate families of similar
objects, and it is recommended to be used when you have limited variations due to the same drawbacks that Factory
and Factory Method have.

It still reigns supreme due to the fact that it decomposes variations into smaller classes and presents a nice,
decoupled and encapsulated interface to generate necessary objects.
